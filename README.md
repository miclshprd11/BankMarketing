# BankMarketing


In this Notebook I go through 4 classification models: SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and KNN. 
I fit these models to bank marketing data where the goal of the campaign is to get customers to sign up for
the term deposit service. 

I find that the Logistic regression model is the best for this use case because the recall metric is higher, giving a 
better idea of what kind of customer is already signed up for this service. 
Using the Logistic regression model I am able to pull out the weights of the feature coefficients in order to tell 
which features are the best indicators. 

The full details of my results, as well as the actionable steps that they suggest, are in the notebook at the bottom.
